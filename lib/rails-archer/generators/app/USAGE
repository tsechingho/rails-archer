Description:
    The 'shoot new' command creates a new Rails application with a default
    directory structure and configuration at the path you specify.

    You can specify extra command-line arguments to be used every time
    'shoot new' runs in the .railsrc configuration file in your home directory.

    Note that the arguments specified in the .railsrc file don't affect the
    defaults values shown above in this help message.

Example:
    shoot new ~/Code/Ruby/trouble-maker

    This generates a skeletal Rails installation in ~/Code/Ruby/trouble-maker.
    See the README in the newly created application to get going.
